# FFmpeg-docker README
(see [below](#original-readme) for the regular FFmpeg README)

This FFmpeg fork uses GitHub Actions to build [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) from source (both from published release `tar.bz2`s as well as arbitrary Git commits/branches) inside Docker images which are published to [the runsascoded/ffmpeg Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/runsascoded/ffmpeg). The latest release is [4.3.1](https://hub.docker.com/layers/runsascoded/ffmpeg/4.3.1/images/sha256-c4579336fdedf7c2eddd2e991b2233a32298cf478af3af34d4843bc3c211fc1a).

## Run `ffmpeg` without installing `ffmpeg`
```
$ docker run runsascoded/ffmpeg -version
ffmpeg version 4.3.1 Copyright (c) 2000-2020 the FFmpeg developers
â€¦
```
These Docker images give you access to specific `ffmpeg` releases, built in [GitHub Actions that you can audit](https://github.com/runsascoded/FFmpeg/runs/1505388217?check_suite_focus=true#step:8:15722).

## Passing arguments
Any arguments you'd normally pass to `fmpeg` can be sent to `docker run runsascoded/ffmpeg` instead.

However, input and output paths must additionally be mounted into the container. For example, if your inputs and outputs are in your current directory (`$PWD`), you can just mount it in (here to `/mnt`, and setting that as the working directory inside the container):
```
# down-sample `./my_video.mp4` to 10Mbps
$ docker run -v "$PWD:/mnt" -w /mnt runsascoded/ffmpeg -i my_video.mp4 -b:v 10M my_video_10M.mp4
```
This is analogous to the undockerized `ffmpeg` command:
```bash
ffmpeg -i my_video.mp4 -b:v 10M my_video_10M.mp4
```

If you run it this way frequently (operating on paths in the current directory), you could define a bash `ffmpeg` function to abstract the boilerplate away:
```bash
ffmpeg() {
  docker run -v "$PWD:/mnt" -w /mnt runsascoded/ffmpeg "$@"
}
```
then pretend you're running a locally-installed `ffmpeg`, as above:
```
ffmpeg -i my_video.mp4 -b:v 10M my_video_10M.mp4
```

FFmpeg README <a id="original-readme"></a>
=============

FFmpeg is a collection of libraries and tools to process multimedia content
such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.

## Libraries

* `libavcodec` provides implementation of a wider range of codecs.
* `libavformat` implements streaming protocols, container formats and basic I/O access.
* `libavutil` includes hashers, decompressors and miscellaneous utility functions.
* `libavfilter` provides a mean to alter decoded Audio and Video through chain of filters.
* `libavdevice` provides an abstraction to access capture and playback devices.
* `libswresample` implements audio mixing and resampling routines.
* `libswscale` implements color conversion and scaling routines.

## Tools

* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) is a command line toolbox to
  manipulate, convert and stream multimedia content.
* [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html) is a minimalistic multimedia player.
* [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) is a simple analysis tool to inspect
  multimedia content.
* Additional small tools such as `aviocat`, `ismindex` and `qt-faststart`.
